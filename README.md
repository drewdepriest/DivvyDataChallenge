DivvyDataChallenge
==================
In February 2014, Chicago's bike sharing program, Divvy, recently published trip data for the 750,000 trips taken in 2013. They're looking to use data to answer burning questions like Where are riders going? When are they going there? How far do they ride? What are top stations? What interesting usage patterns emerge? What can the data reveal about how Chicago gets around on Divvy?
